                <p>Good nutrition is essential for dancers who want to perform at their best. The right balance of carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats helps support energy levels, recovery, and overall health.</p>
                <p>Focus on whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy oils. Staying hydrated before, during, and after class is just as important as what you eat.</p>
                <p>Try to avoid heavy meals right before dancing, and instead choose light snacks that provide steady energy, like a banana with nut butter or yogurt with berries.</p>
                <p>Every dancer’s body is different, so it may take some experimentation to find what works best for you. Listening to your body and fueling it well will help you grow stronger and more confident in every class.</p>
