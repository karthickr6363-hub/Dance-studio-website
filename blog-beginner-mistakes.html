                <p>Starting your dance journey is exciting, but it is normal to make mistakes along the way. Being aware of common pitfalls can help you progress faster and stay motivated.</p>
                <p>Some frequent mistakes include skipping warm-ups, comparing yourself to others, focusing only on speed instead of technique, and not asking questions when you feel stuck.</p>
                <p>At JustDance, we encourage beginners to celebrate small wins, practice consistently, and communicate openly with instructors. This creates a supportive environment where learning feels safe and enjoyable.</p>
                <p>Remember: every expert was once a beginner. Be patient with yourself and enjoy the process of improving one step at a time.</p>
